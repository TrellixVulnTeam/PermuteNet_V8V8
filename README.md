#  Channel-wise Position Encoding

1. Train and Test GAPNet for location classification or image recognition using the following commands:

            cd channel-wise-position-encoding/
            python trainval_gapnet.py 
            python test_gapnet.py 
            
2. Train and Test PermuteNet for location classification or image recognition using the following commands:

            cd channel-wise-position-encoding/
            python trainval_permutenet.py 
            python test_permutenet.py
